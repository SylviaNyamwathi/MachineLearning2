# Logistic Regression Model: 10-Year CHD Risk Prediction  

## Overview  
This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using logistic regression. The analysis includes feature selection, model building, and optimization of the classification threshold based on the most appropriate metric for this problem.  

## Key Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Applied transformations where necessary to improve feature distributions.  

2. **Feature Selection**:  
   - Used domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis to choose key predictors.    

3. **Model Building**:  
   - Built a logistic regression model with interpretable coefficients.  
   - Tested multiple thresholds to identify the optimal trade-off between recall and precision.  

4. **Optimal Threshold**:  
   - Chosen based on maximizing recall while maintaining acceptable precision.  

## Results  
- Model equation with coefficients for interpretation.  
- Insights into key predictors such as age, blood pressure, and glucose levels.  
- Recommendations for risk assessment based on optimized model output.  

## Conclusion  
This analysis demonstrates a systematic approach to building a logistic regression model for CHD prediction, prioritizing actionable insights and public health impact.
